# 👋 Hey, I’m Zaki Khan

From research in Germany to building with emerging tech in New York, I’ve always followed curiosity, not comfort. That curiosity led me to explore AI, product thinking, and entrepreneurship—where I get to combine strategy, data, and impact in ways that matter.

I’m a Computer Science & Business Honors student at Lehigh University. I’m currently interning in AI & Data at EY, a fellow in Cornell Tech’s AI/ML Studio, and building projects that make real problems simpler, smarter, and more human.

**⚠️ Note: My commit activity looks quieter during the spring semester because my Software Engineering course used a private GitHub repo, so those contributions aren’t reflected here 😔**

### 🎯 Featured Project: Census Income Prediction (Machine Learning Foundations)

Check out my work on a machine learning project that analyzes U.S. Census data to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K. This was part of a larger applied machine learning course focused on data preparation, model tuning, and real-world evaluation metrics.

**Tools**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn  
**What I Did**: Cleaned and one-hot encoded 32K+ rows of census data, trained and tuned Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using GridSearchCV, and evaluated performance with accuracy, recall, and overfitting analysis.  
**Results**: Achieved 85%+ accuracy and 58% recall, selecting the optimal model configuration by balancing generalization and interpretability.
